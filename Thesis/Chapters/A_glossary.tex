\chapter{Glossary of Terms} \label{app:glossary}
This glossary provides definitions for the terms utilized throughout this dissertation. The terms are categorized by their domain of origin.

\section*{Artificial Intelligence \& Large Language Models}

\begin{description}[style=nextline, leftmargin=1cm, font=\bfseries]

    \item[Hallucination] 
    A phenomenon in Large Language Models where the system generates text that is syntactically correct but factually incorrect or logically inconsistent with the input context.
    
    \item[In-Context Learning (ICL)] 
    The ability of an LLM to perform a task after being shown a few examples within the prompt, without any permanent updates to its underlying neural weights.
    
    \item[Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting] 
    A prompting technique that encourages an LLM to generate intermediate reasoning steps before arriving at a final answer, often used to improve performance on complex logical or mathematical tasks.

    \item[Temperature] 
    A hyperparameter in LLM generation that controls the randomness of the output. A temperature of 0 aims for the most probable/deterministic response, while higher values increase creativity and variability.

    \item[Model-as-a-Service (MaaS)] 
    A cloud-computing model where pre-trained Large Language Models are hosted by a provider (e.g., Google, OpenAI) and accessed by developers via an API, removing the need for local hardware at the cost of dependency on the provider's infrastructure.

\section*{Semantic Web \& Knowledge Engineering}

\begin{description}[style=nextline, leftmargin=1cm, font=\bfseries]

    \item[Knowledge Graph (KG)] 
    A structured representation of information using a graph-based data model, where nodes represent entities and edges represent the relationships between them, grounded in a formal ontology.

    \item[RDFS (Resource Description Framework Schema)] 
    A formal way of representing properties, and the relationships between those properties, within a specific domain of interest. This work utilizes RDFS to define the "Citizen" and "Public Service" schemas.

    \item[Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language)] 
    A syntax and file format for the Resource Description Framework (RDF) that is designed to be both machine-readable and easily edited by humans.
    
    \item[SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language)] 
    A World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standard for validating RDF graphs against a set of conditions. In this work, it serves as the primary symbolic engine for eligibility verification.
    
    \item[SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol And RDF Query Language)] 
    An RDF query language and data access protocol used to retrieve and manipulate data stored in Resource Description Framework (RDF) format.  

    \item[Graph Edit Distance (GED)] 
    A metric for measuring the similarity between two graphs by calculating the minimum number of operations (node/edge insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to transform one graph into the other.

    \item[Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)] 
    A tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of source code (like SPARQL). Comparing ASTs allows for measuring logical similarity rather than just textual overlap.

\section*{Administrative Law \& Public Governance}

\begin{description}[style=nextline, leftmargin=1cm, font=\bfseries]

    \item[Once-Only Principle (OOP)] 
    A European Union e-government strategy aimed at ensuring that citizens and businesses only have to provide standard information to administrations once, with authorities then sharing this data internally.
    
    \item[Digital Sovereignty] 
    The capacity of a state to exert authority over its digital infrastructure, including the "code" of its laws, without being dependent on proprietary, foreign-controlled ecosystems.
