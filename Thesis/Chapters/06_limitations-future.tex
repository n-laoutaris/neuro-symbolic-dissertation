\chapter{Limitations \& Future Work}

\section{Limitations}
Acknowledge the limited document sample size, API restrictions and the reliance on a specific vendor's ecosystem, limited prompt engineering, limited models (free tier). 
Replication Crisis
Critique the reliance on proprietary Model-as-a-Service infrastructure, arguing that operational instability renders them unsuitable for critical pipelines.
Maybe this can be in the Limitations chapter.

\section{Future Research Directions}
Propose a roadmap for using local open-source models to ensure sovereignty, the implementation of iterative "Self-Correction" agents to fix syntax errors, ideas for more robust testing of this kind of pipeline, ideas not implemented by this work for scoping reasons.

The decision to base the schema on an existing vocabulary was with good reason. This design allows the graphs generated by the pipeline to include more classes of the used ontologies, for future integration with more sophisticated systems. The pipeline itself could also be expanded upon to include more classes.
