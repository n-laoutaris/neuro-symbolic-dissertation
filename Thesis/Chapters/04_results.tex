\chapter{Results}
Here we will only give facts, numbers, graphs. No explanations and opinions.

\section{Syntax Validity}
Present statistical data on how often the pipeline generated syntactically valid RDF and SPARQL code under different configurations.

\section{Logic Validity}
Report the scores and figures for the pipeline logic accuracy, maybe highlighting the discrepancy between "Syntax Success" and "Logic Success." Should further elaborate on failed cases.

\section{Pipeline Reliability}
An aggregation of overall pipeline feasibility combining syntax and logic. 

\section{Semantic Stability (nice-to-have)}
If we have time to do it, this chapter will use data from the semantic similarity metrics drawn from past run artifacts on file.
