\section{Introduction}
This chapter details the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) conducted to establish the theoretical foundations of Neuro-Symbolic AI.

\section{Methodology}

PRISMA guidelines.

\subsection{Research Questions}

\subsection{Research Strategy}
Database: Scopus
Date Range: 2023--2026
Language: English
Query: ( "Large Language Model" OR "LLM" ) AND ( "SHACL" OR "SPARQL" ) AND ( "Semantic Web" OR "Knowledge Graph" )

\subsection{Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria}
During screening:
Exclude usage of KGs for XAI. Include explainability if it's tested on our use case.
Exclude Conference Proceedings Entries.
Include SPARQL query generation by LLM from natural language questions. 
Exclude graph entity alignment.
Exclude "conceptual", "theoretical" and "preliminary results".
Exclude opposite flow: using LLM to produce natural language FROM SPARQL.
Exclude off-topic usage of LLMs (e.g. not as part of the same data pipeline as the KGs).
Exclude comparisons between LLM approaches and Semantic web approaches.
Include prompt engineering comparisons (for the same task as our pipeline). Exclude it for different or generic applications.
Include fine-tuning for use with KGs. Exclude otherwise.
Exclude subgraph extraction by LLM.
