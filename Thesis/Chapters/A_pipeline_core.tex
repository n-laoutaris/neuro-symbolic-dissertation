\chapter{Code for Pipeline Core} \label{app:pipeline_code}

This appendix lists the full python code of the \textit{pipeline core}, the main executable part of the pipeline. It is intended to give a high-level overview only, and for that reason it does not include any of the functions that make up the custom utility libraries, which are used throughout the code. For the entirety of the source code, refer to the dissertation's GitHub repository \cite{repo}, under the \texttt{src} directory.
