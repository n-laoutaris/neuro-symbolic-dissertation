\chapter{Introduction}

An idea I wrote, not sure if it fits here:
Consider this analogy: Building a neuro-symbolic pipeline for public administration is akin to building a high-speed railway between two distinct cultures. The LLM acts as the versatile translator and engineer who interprets the local landscape (unstructured text), while the intermediate YAML or JSON models serve as the blueprints and tracks. The Knowledge Graph is the rigid, reliable station where everyone must follow specific rules (logic). Currently, we have built successful short-distance test tracks (prototypes), but the challenge remains in connecting the entire national network while ensuring the trains (data) always run on time and stay on the correct side of the tracks (normative compliance).

Another nice Analogy: If Descriptive QA is like asking a librarian to find a specific book (retrieval), then Prescriptive synthesis is like asking a lawyer to write a set of building codes (rule-making). In the descriptive case, the model translates a search request into a precise map of the library. In the prescriptive case, the model must understand the underlying intent of a policy and translate it into a rigid framework of "if-then" laws that govern future actions.

And another Analogy: Validating a neuro-symbolic system is like inspecting a bridge built by a highly creative but occasionally distracted architect. Probabilistic methods are like counting how many cars successfully cross the bridge (F1 scores), while deterministic methods are like a safety inspector using a physical measuring tape to ensure the steel beams meet code (SHACL/OBQC). Currently, we are very good at checking if the bridge stands up once (static validation), but we lack a way to simulate an earthquake or a flood (mutation testing) to ensure the architect’s logic doesn't fail under pressure.

\section{Background and Motivation}
The burden of manual bureaucracy in public administration and the potential of AI to automate legislative interpretation.

Why is this work important?

\section{Problem Statement}
the challenge of bridging unstructured text with deterministic validation logic while mitigating LLM hallucinations.

\section{Objectives}
the specific goals of building a Text-to-SHACL pipeline and evaluating its semantic accuracy and operational feasibility.

\section{Dissertation Structure}
Outline of the organization of the subsequent chapters and the logical flow of the research.
