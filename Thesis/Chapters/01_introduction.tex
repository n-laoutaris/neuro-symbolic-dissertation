\chapter{Introduction}
Draft:

While modern digital governance aims for a "proactive" model of service delivery, the primary bottleneck remains the manual translation of legislative text into executable validation logic. This dissertation addresses this gap by proposing a neuro-symbolic pipeline that automates the extraction of eligibility rules. To evaluate the feasibility of this approach, the system is implemented and tested as a Public Service Recommender, where the synthesized logic is used to provide eligible citizens with trustworthy service suggestions.

\section{Background and Motivation}
The burden of manual bureaucracy in public administration and the potential of AI to automate legislative interpretation?

Why is this work important?

\section{Problem Statement}
the challenge of bridging unstructured text with deterministic validation logic while mitigating LLM hallucinations.

\section{Objectives}
the specific goals of building a Text-to-SHACL pipeline and evaluating its semantic accuracy and operational feasibility.

\section{Dissertation Structure}
Outline of the organization of the subsequent chapters and the logical flow of the research.
