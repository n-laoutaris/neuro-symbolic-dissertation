\label{ch:discussion}
Here we will interpret the results and give subjective opinions and other observations.

\section{The Logic Traps}
Interpret the recurring logical failures in logically sound SPARQL generation, discussing the LLM's struggle with aggregations, joins, recurrency and closed loops.

\section{The Syntactic Failures}
Interpret the models' usage of wrong syntax, using other languages (perhaps more training data) despite being explicitly told to avoid it.

\section{Domain Influence}
Discuss the impact of complex vs simple domains or docuents, semantic web wise.

\section{Prompt Engineering}
Discuss the differences the tested prompting techniques made (or didn't make).

\section{Model Size Trade-offs}
Discusses the counter-intuitive finding where the smaller model outperformed the larger model in literal constraint extraction and summarizarion (where else?)
