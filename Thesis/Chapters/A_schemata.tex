\chapter{Citizen Schemas \& Golden Citizens} \label{app:citizen_schemata}
This appendix provides the full \texttt{ttl} files that describe the LLM-generated citizen schemas used as context for the pipeline, as detailed in Section \ref{subsec:citizen_schema}, along with their respective hand-crafted "Golden Citizen" instance graphs described in Section \ref{subsec:golden_citizen}. As per the description of the Experimental Design on Section \ref{sec:experimental_design}, there is one pair of files per document use case.
