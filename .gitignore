# Top-level .gitignore for the Dissertation workspace
# Strategy: ignore almost everything, then whitelist the specific notebooks
# and directories you asked to keep. This avoids accidentally checking in
# large or temporary files while allowing the requested content.

# Ignore everything by default
*

# But don't ignore directory structure — so we can whitelist specific paths
!*/

# Always keep this file tracked
!.gitignore

# Keep the two notebooks in the repo root (names include spaces)
!Citizen Graph Notebook.ipynb
!Dissertation Notebook.ipynb

# Whitelist specific directories and all their subcontents (exact names)
!Citizens/
!Citizens/**

!Good results/
!Good results/**

# Recommended global ignores for OS/editor artifacts and checkpoints
# These will still be ignored even if they appear inside whitelisted folders
# because these patterns are matched after the whitelist entries.

# If you want to also keep other folders (e.g., `lib/` or `Older Versions/`),
# add them above using the same pattern `!path/` and `!path/**`.
